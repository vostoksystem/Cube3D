# this is a language template for unity3d vi18n plugin 
# for each languages your game will support,copy this file into your asset (or create a new one with a file manager)
# rename it as a 2 digits code like en.txt, fr.txt, de.txt...

# add a VI18nManager on a (permanent / static) gameobject to your game.
# drag each translation file onto the source property (you may need to set size first )
# verify that the default language exist and it set correctly (default to en)

# this is a comment

# this is a key - value couple
hello = Hello !

# for convenience you can name key like this
menu.start = Start game
menu.file.open = Open

# key are case sensitive
men.Akey = value for Akey
menu.akey = different value

# key and value are trimed, you can use indent if you like
     menu.foo     =   an other value
     
# value can be multiline 
help.anInfo = this is a value \
on multiple lines \
beware any spaces or tab is therefore part of the value

# value for a font is an url relative to Asset/Resources and without the file type extention
# so for myGame/Assets/Resources/Fonts/NewGameFont.ttf :
base.font = Fonts/NewGameFont
